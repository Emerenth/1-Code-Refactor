## Description

This is a website for the Horiseon marketing corporation. It features a navigation bar at the top with links to the articles on the page. There are three articles with information about the marketing firms services. There is also a sidebar with more info and a footer with copyright information.

## Contributions

The html was originally made up almost entirely of div tags and used classes for things like header and footer instead of using the semantic tags. My contributions mainly consisted of making the code more easily readable with semantic html. I also changed the title from "website" to "Horiseon Marketing" as well as changing the background images class name from "hero" to "background".

I didn't change the css except to keep it working with the updated html. I did, however, add comments to the css. I also moved the styling for the aside tag to be below the main article styling. This fits the way it appears in the html.
