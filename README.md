# 1-Code-Refactor

## Description

This is a homework assignment in which I refactored the html code for a website to be more accessible. The website was for a fictional marketing company called Horiseon.

## Contributions

The html was originally made up almost entirely of div tags and used classes for things like header and footer instead of using the semantic tags. My contributions mainly consisted of making the code more easily readable with semantic html. I also changed the title from "website" to "Horiseon Marketing" as well as changing the background images class name from "hero" to "background".

I didn't change the css except to keep it working with the updated html.
